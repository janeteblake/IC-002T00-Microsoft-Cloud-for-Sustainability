# Module 7 Lesson 2 Lab 5: Goals and scorecard

## Overview

### Background

In the previous four labs, the master and system data were set up and calculations performed to report on emissions. In this lab, the focus is on setting carbon emission reduction goals and tracking them using scorecards. In the scorecard, emission reduction goals can be introduced based on the organization’s sustainability priorities and can be collaboratively tracked with various stakeholders using the Teams collaboration feature.

### Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will do the following:

-   Create Scorecards and Goals to monitor progress towards Carbon reduction targets
-   Understand goal check-ins
-   Configure and use Microsoft Teams Chat collaboration features

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Sustainability manager environment is set up with sample data
-   Lab 1 organization and reference data is entered
-   Lab 2 activity data is ingested
-   Lab 3 emissions are calculated
-   Lab 4 deep analysis and reporting review

### Solution Focus Area

Scorecards and goals can help curate sustainability metrics and track them against an organization’s key business objectives. After the scorecard is created that includes goals, the scorecard progression can be periodically checked including how the scorecard is progressing and to make any required adjustments.

There will probably be times when there is a need to share and discuss data, reports, analytics, or goals across many stakeholders in the organization. To help make those conversations contextual and collaborative, Teams Chat is available directly in Microsoft Sustainability Manager.

### Personas and Scenarios

In this lab, Amber Rodrigues – Sustainability specialist for Contoso Corp creates and monitors Carbon reduction goals. Based on the insights from the Deep Analysis dashboard, Amber creates a new scorecard for Wide World Importers and creates a goal to reduce their carbon emissions from the previous year. Amber sets up automatic goal check-ins to track the ongoing status of the goal.

Finally, Amber, with the help of Reed Flores – IT Admin for Wide World Importers, configures Microsoft Teams collaboration. Once configured, Amber opens a chat with one of their colleagues to discuss changes to a factor library, continuing Ambers great work to record, report, and reduce carbon emissions across Wide World Importers and the entirety of Contoso Corp.

Great job, you have helped Amber create a goal for your scorecard instructing Wide World Importers to reduce their carbon emissions from 900 mtCO2E to 600 mtCO2E. You enabled automatic check-ins and status rules to ensure that the goal is automatically kept up to date. Goals are important to keep track of an organization’s progress towards reducing their carbon footprint. Any goals you have with a current value that is connected to data will have check-ins created roughly every 24 hours. Let’s go ahead and create our first check-in manually so you are familiar with the check-in data.  **Please continue to the next task**

### Task 3: Create a Goal Check-in

In this task, Amber will create a manual goal check-in Wide World Importers Scope 2 reduction goal, this will be for the first check-in, so they do not need to wait 24 hours for the first check-in to occur.

Sometimes we may have goals that are set to use manually check-ins if we are not able to connect data to them, or even after a goal with connected data is created, we need to wait roughly 24 hours for our first check-in to occur. In either of these situations, you may find it useful to be able to create and review a check-in. This task will take you through the process of creating a Goal Check-in.

1.  Amber opens the goal that was created in the previous task by selecting the goal name from the list in the scorecard.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./Images/Lab05/L05_image030.png)

    - **New value** is used to specify the current value of the goal check-in. This value will be used on the Progress chart above
        >[!NOTE]**Note:** In this scenario, the Status will be automatically set based on the Status rules we set on the goal
    - **Note** is optionally used if you want to provide more information or context about the check-in, such as a heatwave increased heating which resulted in an abnormally high carbon emission value for this check-in.

1.  Amber now sees:

    -   The **Progress** section has updated showing the latest check-in value and status, as well its plot on the graph.
    -   The **History** section shows the recently created check-in with the status automatically set based on the goal rules. Check-ins will be shown in the order of newest to oldest.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, email Description automatically generated](./Images/Lab05/L05_image035.png)

Great job, you have just completed the Defining Sustainability Goals exercise. These tasks are critical to helping an organization realize their Sustainability and carbon reduction goals. Some important notes:

-  **Automated Goal check-ins run via a backend service roughly every 24 hours**, based on the time of day when the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability was installed.
-  **As of the current release, there is not a way to change the timing for Automated Goal check-ins**.
-  You can create a manual check-in at any time.
