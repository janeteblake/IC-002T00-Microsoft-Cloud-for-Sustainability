# Module 4 Lesson 2 Lab 2: Data ingestion

## Overview

### Background

In the previous lab, Wide Word Importers’ company profile, facilities, and reference data such as Contractual instrument types were created to lay the Master data foundation for Emissions calculations and Reporting. In this lab - we will perform the Activity data ingestion for the Purchased Electricity of the two newly acquired Florida facilities. In addition, we will also ingest emission data related to the charging of the fleet of 50 Fabrikam Electric trucks. The built-in connectors in the Microsoft Sustainability Manager will be used to ingest the Activity data into the application.

### Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will do the following:

-   Use Microsoft Sustainability Manager connectors to ingest data
-   Use Power Query to transform the data before ingestion
-   Review the ingested data in the “Purchase Electricity Activity Data” Dataverse Table
-   The newly ingested activity data during this lab exercise will be utilized in the remaining scenarios (calculations and reporting) in the upcoming lab exercises.

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Sustainability manager environment is set up with sample data
-   Lab 01 organization and reference data is entered.

### Solution Focus Area

In this lab, the focus is on the “Data Ingestion” aspect of the Solution Focus Area. It follows the “Organization and Reference data Set up” and forms the basis for the emission calculations and the reporting thereafter. The Microsoft Sustainability Manager is flexible with multiple automated options to ingest data – such as the connectors as well as manual inputs. For scenarios that may require complex data transformation and/or ETL, tools like Azure Data Factory are recommended. You can explore this functionality in deeper detail on Microsoft Docs at **Overview of Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability Data Import**, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sustainability/import-data.

### Personas and Scenarios

In this lab, Reed Flores – IT Admin for Wide World Importers utilizes the activity data Excel spreadsheets sourced by Alex Serra – Emissions Analyst. The Activity data spreadsheets contain Electricity Purchased for the year 2021 and Miles driven by the fleet of Fabrikam Electric Trucks for the calendar year 2021. Reed utilizes Microsoft Sustainability Manger’s connector functionality to import from the Excel spreadsheets, and reviews other connectors available for future purposes. Reed uses the built-in Power Query functionality to transform the data to match Microsoft Sustainability Manager’s data schema and looks for other potential issues such as case-sensitive d data fields.

## Exercise 1: Import Data

In this exercise, you will learn about the steps that Reed takes to ingest the spreadsheets given by Alex. Data import is a vital task to bringing large volumes of data into Microsoft Sustainability Manager. Excel is utilized in this lab; however, many pre-built connectors are available, and Partners can build custom connectors to integrate with additional data sources. You can explore this functionality in deeper detail on Microsoft Docs, please visit **Overview of data connectors** at +++https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sustainability/import-data-connectors+++.

>[!ALERT] **Important** Please ensure you have completed the previous lab to create Reference Data. **The data import process requires all Reference Data to exist, and the process is case sensitive, so please ensure the Reference data that was added has the exact same case formatting as what is found in the lab**. Failure to do so will result in errors during the data import process

Great job, you have helped Reed complete the data import of 2021 Purchased Electricity for Wide World Importers. This is an important step to realizing the goal of recording, reporting, and reducing carbon emissions. Next, you will import the 2021 Miles Driven for Wide World Importers fleet of electric vehicles. **Please continue to the next task.**

### Task 2: Import 2021 data “Miles Driven” for Electric Trucks

In this task, Reed imports the second excel spreadsheet provided by Alex - “Fleet Vehicles Miles Driven Wide World Importers - 2021.xlsx”.

Great job, by completing these steps you have helped Reed by using the Microsoft Sustainability Manger’s connector functionality to import from the  “Fleet Vehicles Miles Driven Wide World Importers - 2021.xlsx” spreadsheet, and used the built-in Power Query functionality to transform the data to match Microsoft Sustainability Manager’s data schema. This brings the Miles driven by Wide World Importers fleet of electric truck for the year 2021 into the Purchased electricity activity data.

**Congratulations!** Reed and Alex can use the data you imported for emission calculations and reporting. This is an important step to realizing the goal of recording, reporting, and reducing carbon emissions. In the following labs we will calculate emissions, review insights and reporting, and define our reduction scorecards and goals.
